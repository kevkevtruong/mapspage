<p>Chick-fil-A announced late last month it will stop donating to organizations with a history of opposing LGBTQ rights.</p>

<p>In a statement released on its website, the fast food franchise announced it will start focusing its philanthropic efforts specifically in the areas of education, homelessness and hunger. This means a number of previously funded Christian organizations with a history of campaigning against LGBTQ rights will no longer receive funding through the Chick-fil-A Foundation. </p>

<p>Though the LGBTQ community was not specifically mentioned in the announcement, the announcement does come after years of protests by LGBTQ advocates calling for a boycott of Chick-fil-A because of its associations with anti-LGBTQ organizations.</p>

<p>The announcement was met with mixed reactions, with some skeptical of Chick-fil-A's motivations and others uncertain if the fast food franchise will follow through with its pledge.</p>

<p>Mariano Ruiz serves on the board of the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia and works in LGBTQ advocacy. He doesn't think Chick-fil-A's announcement will have much impact in the broader fight for LGBTQ rights.</p>

<p>"We need to change the narrative and advocate for change with stronger initiatives and innovative approaches to change hearts and minds," Ruiz said. "Conservatives will always be there."

<p>Whether the announcement will have a positive or negative effect on business for Chick-fil-A has yet to be seen. Of the 21 states with the largest number of Chick-fil-A restaurants in the country, only three have any type of non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people written into their state law. Those states are California, Colorado and New Jersey.</p>
